######### we are configuring promethus with thanos on orcale cloud oke cluster ####################

first create oke cluster i am using free cluster but things to remember what types of workers we are creating

1) create cluster
2) put worker nodes on private subnet ---> important point because public subnet worker will not work because of dns issue


############# now we are procedding with deployment you can follow orcale oci guide to create key pair and connect cluster #########

#### cluster connect with compute instance now starting all the deployment for thanos with promethus #######

we have created objstore.yml create exactly this file also you need to create bucket in orcale cloud
you can see the values require in objstore yml file which is bucket name and other things you can check from your oci config file be sure the provide all values there and paste key in exact format which i have place in file
then create secret below


kubectl create secret generic thanos-objstore --from-file=objstore.yml -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl apply -f -

helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -f values.yaml


#### below command to check logs if your thanos side car able to connect bucket and upload metadata file you will have to wait two after successful connection every two hour it will upload it

kubectl logs -f prometheus-prometheus-stack-kube-prom-prometheus-0 -c thanos-sidecar

helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install thanos bitnami/thanos -f thanos.values.yaml

now the svc which we expose thanos  query you can copy ip and port 

go to endpoints there you will see the sidecar and store up or not
