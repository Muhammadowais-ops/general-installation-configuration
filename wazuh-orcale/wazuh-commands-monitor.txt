above link can we use to monitor every commands executed by root 

but we need to monitor every commands so that we need to update audit rules 

we are doing all these settings in orcale linux 


to monitor every command add below entries in audit rules

Add the rules below in the /etc/audit/audit.rules audit rule file:

-a exit,always -F arch=b32 -S execve -k auoms
-a exit,always -F arch=b64 -S execve -k auoms


auditctl -R /etc/audit/audit.rules
auditctl -l
